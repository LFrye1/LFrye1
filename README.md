## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is Lakin Frye, though please feel free to call me "Lake". I'm very excited to start my software developer journey!

Pronouns: She/Her

I live in Pittsburgh, PA and my hobbies include traveling, paddleboarding, reading, and playing video and board games.

Currently, I work in the social services field. I have a Siberian Husky named Mulder, who is always quite mischievous!

I'm always open to feedback or additional learning opportunities!
