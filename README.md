## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, my name is Lakin Frye, though please feel free to call me "Lake". Iâ€™ve always been the type of person who thrives in solving problems, but what really excites me is building the right team to tackle those challenges together. Whether I was leading teams in the social services field to help at-risk youth, or diving into the dynamic world of software development, one thing has always remained constant: my passion for creating solutions that make a meaningful difference.

Over the years, I've honed my ability to empathize, communicate, and guide others toward a common goal. In my previous work, Iâ€™ve led teams that made a real impact, empowering young people to overcome obstacles and build a better future. Now, Iâ€™m channeling that energy into the tech world, where I can combine my problem-solving skills with the power of innovation to create transformative solutions.

Currently, as I pursue my Full-Stack Developer certification at Tech Elevator, Iâ€™m sharpening my skills in Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. I'm also gaining experience in tackling real-world challenges, and working with teams to develop dynamic applications and solutions. Iâ€™m passionate about the endless possibilities in software development and the way technology can transform industries, enhance lives, and drive progress.

If youâ€™re working on a project that could benefit from a fresh perspective or need a dedicated team member whoâ€™s not afraid of a challenge, letâ€™s connect! Iâ€™m always up for new opportunities and collaborations, and Iâ€™d love to explore how we can make a lasting impact together.
